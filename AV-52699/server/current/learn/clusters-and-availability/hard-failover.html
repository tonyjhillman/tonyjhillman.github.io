<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hard failover takes an unresponsive node out of the cluster.
Hard failover can be performed on any node in the cluster: slightly different actions are taken for each affected service, as described below.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hard failover should <em>only</em> be used when a node has become unresponsive: it should not be used as part of regular, planned maintenance activities that can be conducted with all cluster-nodes available.
For information on taking nodes out of the cluster in such circumstances, see
<a href="removal.html" class="xref page">Removal</a> and <a href="graceful-failover.html" class="xref page">Graceful Failover</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hard failover can be initiated by means of:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Couchbase Web Console, manually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The CLI or REST API; either manually, or from a <em class="path">script/program/ops</em> platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Automatic Failover</em>, triggered by the Cluster Manager: see <a href="automatic-failover.html" class="xref page">Automatic Failover</a>.</p>

<h2 id="default-and-unsafe"><a class="anchor" href="#default-and-unsafe"></a>Hard Failover in Default and Unsafe Modes</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the event of a cluster&#8217;s <a href="cluster-manager.html#master-services" class="xref page">Master Services</a> not being able to contact a majority of the cluster&#8217;s nodes (sometimes referred to as a <em>quorum failure</em>), an attempted failover will <em>not</em> be executed.
This protects the cluster from the situation where:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The cluster&#8217;s nodes get divided into two separate sets, due to an unanticipated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_partition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">network partition</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each of the separate sets is accessed by a different administrator&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;each administrator being unaware of the other&#8217;s access.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each administrator simultaneously performs a hard failover of the nodes they cannot contact (resulting in a corrupted cluster-configuration, once the network partition is healed).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that this restriction also protects the cluster in situations where multiple <a href="groups.html" class="xref page">Server Groups</a> are accidentally divided into separate sets, in the same way.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="performing-an-unsafe-failover"><a class="anchor" href="#performing-an-unsafe-failover"></a>Performing an Unsafe Failover</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Couchbase Server 7.0+, metadata is managed by a <em>consensus protocol</em>; which achieves strong consistency by <em>synchronously</em> replicating metadata to a majority of the nodes before considering it committed.
(This is described in <a href="metadata-management.html" class="xref page">Metadata Management</a>.)
The metadata so managed includes <em>topology information</em>.
Consequently, in the event of a quorum failure, no topology changes can be made on the cluster-nodes that remain responsive.
Specifically, this means that:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Buckets, scopes, and collections can neither be created nor dropped.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nodes cannot be added, joined, failed over safely, or removed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order that users do not have to abandon a cluster in which a majority of nodes have failed or are unreachable, hard failover can be performed in <em>unsafe</em> mode.
Unsafe failovers override the consensus protocol; and may be performed even if a majority of nodes in the cluster cannot be contacted.
No unsafe failover should be attempted without a full understanding of the consequences and requirements, which are listed immediately below.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="consequences-of-unsafe-failover"><a class="anchor" href="#consequences-of-unsafe-failover"></a>Consequences of Unsafe Failover</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Couchbase Server Version 7.0+, the consequences of unsafe failover are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Strong consistency of metadata is no longer guaranteed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Metadata may have been lost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The nodes that have been failed over are also immediately <em>removed</em> from the cluster.
They are, however, not informed of their removal; and so may continue to attempt to behave as if members of the cluster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The failed over nodes <em>cannot be recovered</em>; and will therefore need to be <em>re-initialized</em>, if they are to be re-introduced into the cluster.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The consequences of unsafe failover in Couchbase Server Version 7.0+ are therefore significantly different from in previous versions: previously, the failed over nodes remained in the cluster, and could be recovered; but in 7.0+, they are removed from the cluster, are non-recoverable, and must be re-initialized before being added back to the cluster.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="client-communications-following-unsafe-failover"><a class="anchor" href="#client-communications-following-unsafe-failover"></a>Client Communications following Unsafe Failover</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Following unsafe failover, the cluster provides clients running the latest SDK with updated information on the buckets that exist on the surviving cluster.
This prevents those clients from incorrectly acknowledging any subset of contactable, failed-over nodes as the real cluster.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="requirements-for-unsafe-failover"><a class="anchor" href="#requirements-for-unsafe-failover"></a>Requirements for Unsafe Failover</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Prior to unsafe failover:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A <em>safe</em> failover should be attempted; in order to verify that safe failover is indeed not possible; and that unsafe failover is the only viable option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It should be ascertained that no other administrator will be attempting to perform a simultaneous, unsafe failover.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It should be ascertained that all nodes to be unsafely failed over are permanently down; and are thereby incapable of restarting and attempting to resume communication with the cluster.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As described above, in <a href="#consequences-of-unsafe-failover">Consequences of Unsafe Failover</a>, following unsafe failover, the failed-over nodes cannot be recovered; and will need to be entirely re-initialized, in order to be re-introduced into the cluster.
Therefore, the administrator may wish to preserve the nodes' data; and, once the cluster is re-established, restore that data to the cluster manually (for example, by means of a tool such as <a href="#cli:cbtools/cbtransfer.adoc" class="xref unresolved">cbtransfer</a>).</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that to have <em>survived</em> the failover, a node must be up and reachable by the other nodes that have survived.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="data-service"><a class="anchor" href="#data-service"></a>Data Service</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since active vBuckets have become unavailable, the Cluster Manager promotes replica vBuckets to active status on the remaining cluster-nodes.
A revised cluster-map is then communicated to all clients.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the process is complete, no further attempts will be made to access vBuckets on the failed-over node, but the node has not yet been fully taken out of the cluster.
The cluster is at this point considered to be in a <em>degraded state</em>, in terms of availability; as it now contains a reduced number of replica vBuckets, and may lack resources for handling a further node-outage.
Rebalance should be performed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="index-service"><a class="anchor" href="#index-service"></a>Index Service</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When Global Secondary Indexes (GSIs) are defined, each is by default created on only one node, which is running the Index Service.
If that node fails, the indexes therefore become unavailable.
If the node is subsequently repaired and added back into the cluster by means of <a href="recovery.html#delta-recovery" class="xref page">Delta Recovery</a>, the indexes are updated, and become available again.
If the node is replaced, the indexes need to be recreated: in this case, before rebalance of the new node into the cluster, the failed node must be taken out of the cluster by means of hard failover.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="query-service"><a class="anchor" href="#query-service"></a>Query Service</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Query Service nodes are stateless, and can be added to and removed from the cluster with no consequence to data.
However, ongoing queries on those nodes are interrupted by hard failover, and therefore produce errors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As long as one Query Service node continues to be available, the cluster continues to support querying, although potentially with reduced performance.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="search-service"><a class="anchor" href="#search-service"></a>Search Service</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If multiple nodes run the Search Service, Full Text Indexes are partitioned, and are automatically distributed across those nodes.
If a Search Service node is failed over, it stops taking traffic.
If no other nodes run the Search Service, all building of Full Text Indexes stops, and searches fail.
If at least one other node is running the Search Service, this continues to handle queries and return partial results.
However, in the case where one other node is running the Search service <em>and</em> a replica has been configured for the index, queries will continue to get full results as the replica will be promoted to active status immediately upon failover.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a rebalance occurs:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If replicas have been configured for Full Text Indexes, the Search Service will generate new replica index partitions if the cluster size permits it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If replicas have <em>not</em> been configured, the Search Service rebuilds the index partitions on the remaining nodes of the cluster, using stored index definitions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that the Search Service is not supported by Delta Recovery.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="eventing-service"><a class="anchor" href="#eventing-service"></a>Eventing Service</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a cluster contains a single node that hosts the Eventing Service, and this node undergoes hard failover, the Eventing Service on the node stops, and mutation-processing on the node is interrupted: this results in a complete halt of Eventing-Service function-execution and mutation-processing.
If the node is restored to the cluster, and the Eventing Service is restarted, Eventing-Service functions redeploy, and mutation-processing resumes: however, this may result in the processing of mutations that are duplicates of mutations made immediately prior to failover, and may result in inappropriate changes to data, if the business logic in function-code is not idempotent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If multiple cluster-nodes host the Eventing Service, responsibility for handling data-mutations is divided between these nodes; with each node handling the data-mutations for a defined subset of vBuckets.
If a hard failover is performed on one of the Eventing-Service nodes, the failed-over node&#8217;s former responsibilities are assigned to the surviving Eventing-Service nodes as part of the hard-failover process&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;thereby ensuring continuity of mutation-processing, and avoiding the immediate need for a rebalance.
If hard failover is, in these circumstances, selected by means of Couchbase Web Console, a notification such as the following is provided, when failover-confirmation is requested: <em>Failover of this node will trigger internal processing after failover for the following service: Eventing.</em>
<em>This processing may take some time to complete.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that vBucket reallocations that occur due to failover may themselves lead to the processing of mutations that are duplicates of mutations made prior to failover.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The processing of duplicate mutations can happen only within a limited time-window, following the last completed DCP checkpoint.</p>

<h3 id="hard-failover-and-the-analytics-service"><a class="anchor" href="#hard-failover-and-the-analytics-service"></a>Analytics Service</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Analytics Service uses <em>shadow data</em>, which is a copy of all or some of the data maintained by the Data Service.
By default, the shadow data is not replicated; however, it may be partitioned across all cluster nodes that run the Analytics Service.
Starting with Couchbase Server 7.1, the shadow data and its partitions may be replicated up to 3 times.
Each replica resides on an Analytics node: a given Analytics node can host a replica partition, or the active partition on which replicas are based.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If there are <em>no</em> Analytics replicas, and an Analytics node fails over, the Analytics Service stops working cluster-wide: ingestion of shadow data stops and no Analytics operations can be run.
In this case:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If the Analytics node is recovered, the Analytics Service is resumed and ingestion of shadow data resumes from the point before the node failed over.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the Analytics node is removed, the Analytics Service becomes active again after rebalance, but ingestion of shadow data must begin again from scratch.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If there <em>are</em> Analytics replicas, and an Analytics node fails over, the Analytics Service continues to work: one of the replicas is promoted to serve the shadow data that was stored on the failed over node.
The Analytics Service only needs to rebuild any shadow data that isn&#8217;t already ingested from the Data Service, depending on the state of the promoted replica.
In this case:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If data is not available, due to the unresponsiveness of a Data-Service node, or due to data-loss that occurs in consequence of a subsequent hard failover, a scheduled backup will fail.
If data becomes accessible again, due to replica-promotions that occur in consequence of a hard failover, the Backup Service locates the data, and a scheduled backup will succeed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a <em>follower</em> Backup-Service node becomes unresponsive, or is lost due to a subsequent hard-failover, the Backup Service continues to operate; using the <em>leader</em> Backup-Service node, and any surviving <em>follower</em> nodes.
If the <em>leader</em> Backup-Service node becomes unresponsive, or is lost due to a subsequent hard-failover, the Backup Service ceases to operate; until a rebalance is performed.
During this rebalance, ns_server elects a new <em>leader</em>, and the Backup Service resumes operations.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a node is added back to the cluster using Delta Recovery, the replica vBuckets on the failed-over node are considered to be <em>trusted</em>, but <em>behind on data</em>.
The Cluster Manager therefore resynchronizes the vBuckets, so that their data becomes current.
When this operation is complete, vBuckets are promoted to active status as appropriate, and the cluster map is updated.</p>

<li>
<p>If the node is added back using <a href="recovery.html#full-recovery" class="xref page">Full Recovery</a>, the node is treated as an entirely new node: it is reloaded with data, and requires rebalance.</p>
