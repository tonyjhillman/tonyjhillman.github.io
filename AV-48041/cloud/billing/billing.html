In Couchbase Capella, you are billed for the size and number of clusters in your organization.

Billing settings apply to all projects and clusters within an organization.
Any user with the <a href="../organizations/organization-user-roles.html#organization-role-organization-owner" class="xref page"><code>Organization Owner</code></a> role can configure billing settings and view costs at both the organization level, as well as at the project and cluster levels.</p>

<p>Couchbase Capella charges <em>by the clock hour</em> for Couchbase clusters.
Each cluster costs an individual hourly rate based on its <em>size</em> (number of logical cores and amount of RAM) as well as its selected <em>Service Plan</em>.
If you change a cluster&#8217;s <a href="../clusters/scale-cluster.html" class="xref page">size</a> or <a href="manage-billing.html#change-support-plan" class="xref page">Service Plan</a> after initial deployment, the hourly rate will increase or decrease commensurate with the changes.</p>

Couchbase Capella deployed in your own cloud does not bill you for cloud infrastructure costs, such as compute, storage, and data transfer.
In these deployments, Couchbase clusters run in your own <a href="../clouds/clouds.html" class="xref page">connected cloud</a>, and thus infrastructure costs are billed to you by your respective cloud provider(s).
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A cluster becomes billable once it is successfully deployed and enters a running state.
You are billed for each clock hour in which the cluster runs.
For example, if a cluster were to begin running at 10:30, and then stop running at 11:30 on the same day, the result would be two billable hours since the cluster was running during two clock hours.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All hourly cluster charges are <em>tabulated daily</em>.
This means that the hourly charges for the current day are not reflected in your organization&#8217;s balance until the next calendar day.
All tabulated daily usage is reported into <em>monthly usage periods</em> that align with each calendar month.
A <a href="manage-billing.html#usage-reports" class="xref page">Usage Summary</a> is provided for each monthly usage period, breaking down all of the billable cluster usage that occurred during each month.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Organizations that pay <a href="#on-demand-payment">on-demand</a> are billed <em>per monthly usage period</em>.
Organizations that pay <a href="#up-front-payment">up-front</a> will see cluster charges deducted from their remaining balance after each day&#8217;s tabulation.</p>

<div class="admonitionblock note">

<td class="icon">

<td class="content">
Since the organizations that pay up-front are charged after each calendar day, the monthly usage periods serve only as a reporting function for those organizations&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;not a monthly bill.
An exception to this is when an organization runs out of pre-paid <a href="#couchbase-cloud-credits">Couchbase Capella Credits</a>.
In that case, the organization may fall back to paying on-demand, and may receive a bill for any on-demand usage that occurred during a monthly usage period, which would then need to be paid in arrears.

<h3 id="up-front-payment"><a class="anchor" href="#up-front-payment"></a>Up-Front Payments</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When purchased <em>up-front</em>, Couchbase Capella Credits are deposited in your organization&#8217;s account, giving your organization a positive balance of credits.
These are known as <em>pre-paid credits</em>.
This balance is drawn down over time based on usage.
The balance is updated once per calendar day to reflect the previous calendar day&#8217;s cumulative usage across all clusters in your organization.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additional credits must be purchased and deposited into your organization&#8217;s account before the balance reaches zero, or before the current credits expire, whichever happens first.
An invoice for the purchased credits, denominated in the currency-equivalent outlined in your purchase agreement, will be sent to your organization&#8217;s billing contact for payment.</p>

<h3 id="on-demand-payment"><a class="anchor" href="#on-demand-payment"></a>On-Demand Payments</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If paying <em>on-demand</em>, your organization is not required to keep a positive balance of Couchbase Capella Credits.
Instead, your organization is billed in arrears for the Couchbase Capella Credits that were used in the previous calendar month.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once a new calendar month begins, you can review the previous month&#8217;s Usage Summary to see all of the billable usage that occurred in your organization, denominated in Couchbase Capella Credits.
An invoice for this usage, denominated in the currency-equivalent outlined in your purchase agreement, will then be sent to your organization&#8217;s billing contact for payment.</p>

<h2 id="activation-id"><a class="anchor" href="#activation-id"></a>Activation IDs</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An <em>Activation ID</em> is required in order to start using <a href="#couchbase-cloud-credits">Couchbase Capella Credits</a> for deploying clusters.
An Activation ID will be emailed to your billing contact after you either complete a purchase agreement with Couchbase Sales, or you register for a Free Trial.
Once you receive your Activation ID, you will then need to <a href="manage-billing.html#add-activation-id" class="xref page">add it to your organization</a> to enable Couchbase Capella Credits.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you paid for Couchbase Capella Credits <a href="#up-front-payment">up-front</a>, adding the Activation ID to your organization will deposit your purchased Couchbase Capella Credits into your organization&#8217;s account.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are paying <a href="#on-demand-payment">on-demand</a> for Couchbase Capella Credits, adding the Activation ID to your organization will enable you to immediately start spending credits on deploying clusters.
Your organization will pay for these credits in arrears for each calendar month of usage.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you registered for a Free Trial, your Activation ID will deposit a set number of Couchbase Capella Credits into your organization&#8217;s account.</p>

<h2 id="support-plans"><a class="anchor" href="#support-plans"></a>Service Plans</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All clusters in an organization must be on a <em>Service Plan</em>.
When you create a cluster, you will select an available plan for that cluster.
The plan that you choose for a cluster determines its capabilities and the level of support it can receive.
You can change a cluster&#8217;s plan at any time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two types of Service Plans:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="#free-trial-plan">Free Trial and Basic Service Plan</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="#paid-plan">Paid Service Plans</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="free-trial-plan"><a class="anchor" href="#free-trial-plan"></a>Free Trial and Basic Service Plan</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <strong>Basic</strong> service plan is available with the free trial of Couchbase Capella, hosted by Couchbase.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A Trial Activation ID comes with a limited number of <a href="#couchbase-cloud-credits">Couchbase Capella Credits</a> that can be spent on clusters.
These credits are valid for a limited amount of time (typically 30 days), after which they expire.
During the trial period, you can spend these credits on deploying any number of clusters, with no restrictions on size or functionality.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, it&#8217;s important to note that, similar to paid plans, clusters on the Free Trial Service Plan cost an hourly rate that varies based on the size of the cluster.
This rate is deducted from the balance of Couchbase Capella Credits that come with the Trial Activation ID.
Therefore, you should be judicious in the size and number of clusters that you deploy, so as not to exhaust all of your Couchbase Capella Credits before you are done trialing Couchbase Capella.
Deploying fewer, smaller clusters will use fewer Couchbase Capella Credits than deploying a great number of large clusters.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once all of the Couchbase Capella Credits from a Trial Activation ID have been exhausted&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;or when any remaining credits expire (whichever happens first)&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;all clusters currently on the Free Trial plan will automatically be <em>suspended</em>.
When a cluster is suspended, you will no longer be able to read or write data on it. You have the option of deleting suspended clusters, or re-enabling them by activating a Paid Activation ID.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Support is available via Couchbase forums only, on a best effort basis.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="paid-plan"><a class="anchor" href="#paid-plan"></a>Paid Service Plans</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Paid Service Plans are available for organizations that are using a <a href="#activation-id">Paid Activation ID</a>.
If your organization is currently using a Paid Activation ID, the paid plans will be selectable when creating clusters.
(Note that the Basic, or Free Trial, plans are not available if your organization is using a Paid Activation ID.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Paid plans are required for perpetual use of Couchbase Capella, and come with traditional levels of support.
The plan that you choose for a cluster determines its capabilities and the level of support it can receive.
You can change a cluster&#8217;s plan at any time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Details of all the available Service Plans can be found on the <a href="https://couchbase.com/support-policy/cloud">Capella Support Policy page</a>.</p>
